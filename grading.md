## Dobiosz (14/15P)

### 1 Exploring Hyperparameters (5/5P)

 * hyperparameter values make sense
   * yes (1P)
 * networks were trained correctly
   * yes (1P)
 * there are results
   * yes (1P)
 * report and visualization
   * perfect (2P)
   * well-structured and easily readable code made grading very convenient :)

### 2 Dataset (5/5P)

 * sufficient images captured
   * yes (1P)
 * sufficient images annotated
   * yes (2P)
 * annotations compatible with HaGRID dataset
   * yes (1P)
 * confusion matrix
   * yes (1P)
   * I wonder why the model performed so poorly?

### 3 Media Controls (5/5P)

 * three hand poses are tracked and distinguished reliably
   * could be better - "down" was almost impossible (1P)
 * three media control features implemented
   * yes (1P)
 * mapping works and makes sense
   * yes (1P)
 * low latency
   * kind of (1P)
