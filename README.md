# Assignment 5

## Exercise 1

In the notebook, 6 different models are trained: a baseline model without any data augmentation layer and 5 models with a single data-augmentation layer added. The results are then displayed and reported. </br>

The notebook can be run as is, only the Path (first cell) to the hagrid subsample has to be set.

## Exercise 2

A pretrained model is used to predict the annotated images and a confusion matrix is displayed at the end.

## Exercise 3

Starting the classifier_gesture.py will display a connected camera. You can then use the signs: </br>

- 'peace' to start or pause the media
- 'like' to increase media volume
- 'dislike' to decrease media volume

It is advised to use a white background and hold the hand somewhat close to the camera.
